ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES - COMPLETE GUIDE
===========================================

WHAT ARE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES?
--------------------------------
These are settings that tell your website where to find your database
and how to connect to it. Think of them as "addresses" and "passwords"
that your website needs to work.

===========================================
EACH VARIABLE EXPLAINED:
===========================================

1. MONGODB_URI
---------------
WHAT IT IS:
Your database connection address (like a website URL for your database)

WHAT IT DOES:
Tells your website where to find your database on the internet

HOW TO GET IT:
You need a MongoDB account (free). See instructions below.

EXAMPLE:
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/database?retryWrites=true&w=majority

WHERE TO GET:
- Sign up at: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
- Create a free cluster
- Get connection string from Atlas dashboard


2. DB_NAME
----------
WHAT IT IS:
The name of your database (like a folder name)

WHAT IT DOES:
Tells your website which database to use

HOW TO FILL:
- If you already have a database, use its name
- If creating new, use any name you like (e.g., "mydatabase", "cpenal_db")

EXAMPLE:
mydatabase
or
cpenal_db

NOTE:
You can choose any name you want. This is just a label.


3. COLLECTION_NAME
------------------
WHAT IT IS:
The name of the table where user registration data is stored

WHAT IT DOES:
Tells your website where to save/find user registration information

HOW TO FILL:
Use: users
(This is the default name. If your data is in a different table, use that name)

EXAMPLE:
users

NOTE:
If you're not sure, use "users" - this is the standard name.


4. ADMIN_COLLECTION
-------------------
WHAT IT IS:
The name of the table where admin user accounts are stored

WHAT IT DOES:
Tells your website where to save/find admin login information

HOW TO FILL:
Use: admins
(This is the default name)

EXAMPLE:
admins

NOTE:
This is where admin signup requests and approved admins are stored.


5. ADMIN_EMAIL
--------------
WHAT IT IS:
The email address for the main admin (super admin) account

WHAT IT DOES:
This is the email you'll use to login to the admin panel

HOW TO FILL:
- Use your own email address
- Or use: admin@example.com (default)

EXAMPLE:
admin@example.com
or
yourname@gmail.com

NOTE:
This is the email you'll use to login. Make sure you remember it!


6. ADMIN_PASSWORD
-----------------
WHAT IT IS:
The password for the main admin account

WHAT IT DOES:
This is the password you'll use to login to the admin panel

HOW TO FILL:
- Choose a strong password (at least 8 characters)
- Or use: admin123 (default - CHANGE THIS!)

EXAMPLE:
admin123
or
MySecurePass123!

WARNING:
Change the default password in production! Don't use "admin123" for real sites.

STEP-BY-STEP: SETTING UP MONGODB
===========================================

IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONGODB YET:

Step 1: Create MongoDB Account (FREE)
--------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
2. Click "Try Free"
3. Fill in:
   - Email address
   - Password
   - First name, Last name
   - Company (optional)
4. Click "Create your Atlas account"
5. Verify your email

Step 2: Create a Free Cluster
------------------------------
1. After login, you'll see "Create a Deployment"
2. Select: FREE (M0) - Shared
3. Cloud Provider: Choose AWS (or any)
4. Region: Choose closest to you
5. Cluster Name: Leave default or change to "Cluster0"
6. Click "Create Deployment"
7. Wait 3-5 minutes for cluster to be created

Step 3: Create Database User
-----------------------------
1. You'll see "Create Database User"
2. Authentication Method: Password
3. Username: Enter a username (e.g., "admin" or "myuser")
4. Password: Click "Autogenerate Secure Password" OR create your own
5. IMPORTANT: SAVE THE PASSWORD! You'll need it.
6. Click "Create Database User"

Step 4: Set Network Access
---------------------------
1. Click "Network Access" in left menu
2. Click "Add IP Address"
3. Click "Allow Access from Anywhere" (for development)
   OR add specific IPs
4. Click "Confirm"

Step 5: Get Connection String
------------------------------
1. Click "Database" in left menu
2. Click "Connect" button on your cluster
3. Choose "Connect your application"
4. Driver: Node.js
5. Version: 5.5 or later
6. Copy the connection string
   It looks like:
   mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Step 6: Update Connection String
---------------------------------
1. Replace <username> with your database username
2. Replace <password> with your database password
3. Add your database name at the end:
   ...mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   Change to:
   ...mongodb.net/your_database_name?retryWrites=true&w=majority

EXAMPLE:
Original:
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Updated:
mongodb+srv://admin:MyPassword123@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/mydatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority

===========================================
QUICK SETUP EXAMPLE
===========================================

IF YOU'RE STARTING FRESH, USE THESE VALUES:

MONGODB_URI:
mongodb+srv://admin:YourPassword123@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/cpenal_db?retryWrites=true&w=majority
(Replace "YourPassword123" and "xxxxx" with your actual values)

DB_NAME:
cpenal_db

COLLECTION_NAME:
users

ADMIN_COLLECTION:
admins

ADMIN_EMAIL:
admin@example.com
(Or your email)

ADMIN_PASSWORD:
admin123
(Change this to something secure!)

===========================================
HOW TO FILL IN VERCEL:
===========================================

When deploying on Vercel:

1. Go to your project settings
2. Click "Environment Variables"
3. For each variable:
   - Click "Add New"
   - Enter Variable Name (exactly as shown)
   - Enter Variable Value (your actual value)
   - Select Environment: Production, Preview, Development (or all)
   - Click "Save"

IMPORTANT:
- Variable names are CASE-SENSITIVE
- Use exact names: MONGODB_URI (not mongodb_uri)
- Don't add quotes around values
- Make sure there are no extra spaces

===========================================
TESTING YOUR VALUES:
===========================================

After setting up:

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Go to: https://your-site.vercel.app/admin/
3. Try to login with ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD
4. If it works, your values are correct!
5. If you get errors, check:
   - MONGODB_URI is correct
   - Password in URI matches your database password
   - Database name matches DB_NAME
   - Network access allows Vercel IPs

===========================================
NEED HELP?
===========================================

Common Issues:

1. "Cannot connect to MongoDB"
   → Check MONGODB_URI is correct
   → Check password in URI matches database password
   → Check network access allows all IPs

2. "Database not found"
   → MongoDB creates database automatically
   → Just make sure DB_NAME matches what you put in URI

3. "Collection not found"
   → Collections are created automatically when you add data
   → Just make sure COLLECTION_NAME is correct

4. "Login not working"
   → Check ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD are correct
   → Default is: admin@example.com / admin123

===========================================
SUMMARY:
===========================================

MONGODB_URI → Get from MongoDB Atlas (connection string)
DB_NAME → Choose any name (e.g., "cpenal_db")
COLLECTION_NAME → Use "users"
ADMIN_COLLECTION → Use "admins"
ADMIN_EMAIL → Your email or "admin@example.com"
ADMIN_PASSWORD → Your password or "admin123"

That's it! Once you fill these, your site will work!
